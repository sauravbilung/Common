Committing data to a repository :
After cofiguring git in linux and creating an account on Github these steps are followed :
1) create a repository in github

2) Goto the projects folder which we want to commit.

3) type "git init" : This command sets up all of the necessary files and directories that Git will use to keep track of everything. Basically it creates a local repository for versioning. It will have all the information which git will need to for version control.

4) git add . :There is a space between "add" and ".". It puts the project into staging area.This means git will keep all the newly added or modified files here. It helps git know what changes/additions will be made to the git repository.

5) git commit -m "m flag indicates the message which is added here".

6) git remote add orgin "github repository url".
   To see what orgin are configured : git remote -v
   To delete an existing origin : git remote rm origin 

7) git push -f origin master
